         <b>Implicit-PDF</b> We introduce a method to predict arbitrary distributions over the rotation manifold. This is particularly useful for pose estimation of symmetric and nearly symmetric objects, since output distributions can include both uncertainty on the estimation and the symmetries of the object.  
         In the display above, we visualize the full space of rotations by representing each rotation as one of its canonical axes (displayed as a point on the sphere via Mollweide projection), and the tilt angle around that axis (displayed via color).
         A cube has 24-fold rotational symmetry, meaning there are 24 equivalent orientations which must be captured for accurate pose estimation.
         We display the ground truth orientations as the large, unfilled circle markers.
         The output from an Implicit-PDF model is then displayed as filled markers proportional in size to their probability.

    The prevailing approach to single-image pose estimation in the deep learning era is to classify or regress a single given ground truth pose per image. This has two main shortcomings, i) it cannot represent uncertainty about the predictions, and ii) it cannot handle symmetric objects, where multiple (potentially infinite) poses may be correct. Recently, these limitations have been partially addressed, but current approaches still cannot express the full rich space of distributions on the rotation manifold. To this end, we introduce a method to estimate arbitrary, non-parametric distributions on SO(3). Our key idea is to represent the distributions implicitly, with a neural network that estimates the probability density given the input image and a candidate pose. Grid sampling or gradient ascent can be used to find the most likely pose, but it is also possible to evaluate the density at any pose, enabling reasoning about symmetries and uncertainty. This is the most general way of representing distributions on manifolds, and to demonstrate its expressive power we introduce a new dataset of challenging symmetric and nearly symmetric objects. Our method requires no supervision on pose uncertainty â€“ the model trains only with a single pose per example. Nonetheless, we find our implicit model is able to accurately predict complex distributions over 3D pose. Surprisingly, in addition to its expressiveness, our model is also an accurate pose estimator in non-ambiguous environments, reaching state-of-the-art performance on many categories of pose estimation benchmarks like Pascal3D+ and ModelNet10-SO(3).
